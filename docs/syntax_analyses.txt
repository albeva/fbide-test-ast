Goals:
- build & analyze AST on the fly as user types in the source code
- provide code completition
  * functions
  * variables
  * arguments
  * keywords
- provide errors & warnings
  * wrong type
  * wrong number of arguments
  * undeclared function
  * undeclared variable

Hurdles:
- scintilla lexer only receives input characters
- scintilla lexes entire lines at once
- scintilla re-lexes the source following a modification
- text cut, paste are handled outside.
- need to bridge subclass of wxStyledTextCtrl & LexerFreeBasic
- lexing must be possible independently without invoking scintilla
  * include files
  * related files in the project
  * caching

Need:
- modifiable AST
- ast nodes are fault tolerant - can be in incomplete/invalid state
- apply error state only after new line ?
- ast nodes preserve position and case
- easy to move ast around
- line lookup cache
- symbol table
- scope aweness - to provide proper completition list


- trigger parse only after full identifier is written
- trigger sem. analyses only after a new line
- from parser use EXPECT to provide next expected token to the user
  if it matches the cursor position
- lex only changes & reuse tokens
  * after inserting a character to an identifier then create token once
    and later only update
  * when inserting text should only scan the inserted range
  * when deleting text should only remove token range
  * when deleting a character modify existing token until word is deleted
    only then remove the token
  * when deleting / adding a token that affects multiple lines - set range that
    must be updated
